# Library Timeline
This project seeks to help users prioritize the order of books read in order to maximize book completion before their due date.

### Why Library Timeline?
In the past year, I have become an avid reader, and I love to utilize the library for ebooks and audio books. However, the issue with depending on the library is, of course, not everything is available at opportune times: the second book of a series may be available now while the first book of a series may be available in two weeks. With the ability to have up to thirty books borrowed at a time, plus twenty waiting in your holds, things can get overwhelming.

With this project, I am aiming to give users a straight-forward plan on the order in which to enjoy books to maximize the amount of books read before their due date.

### What are the thoughts behind the design decisions?
I am using this project as a learning opportunity for me to try out different skills: Go, Kakfa, Terraform, and Kubernetes. It's really motivating to pair new skills with a project I am passionate about! For more information on why I have chosen these skills and more info on the project architecture, check out the Skills and Architecture wiki. (Link)

### There's not much code here. What's going on?
This is an ongoing project, and because I have challenged myself to learn many new skills along the way, it may take more time. I will be trying to keep this repository as up-to-date as possible to show my progress!
